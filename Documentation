This will show all tools and needed to be installed as well as how to use the code in the README file.

In order to be able to run the code below one needs to have kallisto, python, and R installed.
In order to install python one can go to the following link: https://www.python.org/downloads/. 
Usually a macbook pro has python already in the terminal. All they need to do is type python into the terminal.
I am using a server that already has kallisto on it. In case you do not have kallisto one can install it. 
 For a Macbook you most likely also need to install homebrew as well. You would type the following into the terminal.
 One would need this: /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" and 
 this: brew install kallisto. The R package can be installed by a certain package. This will be listed further on."
